- "Create Akash config for..."

### Examples

```
> Generate an SDL for a simple nginx web server

> Create an Akash deployment for WordPress with a MySQL database

> Generate SDL for a game server with a dedicated IP
```

## Usage by Agent

This skill can be used with various AI coding assistants:

### Claude Code
```bash
claude skill add https://github.com/akash-network/akash-sdl-skill
```

### Cursor
Copy the contents of the `rules/` directory to your project's `.cursorrules` file or add as project rules in Cursor settings.

### Windsurf
Add the rules content to Cascade rules or memory for persistent context.

### Cline
Add as custom instructions in Cline extension settings.

### Codex / OpenCode
Include the rules as system prompt context when initializing your session.

### Generic Integration
