# Akash Network Terminology

Key terms and concepts used throughout the Akash Network.

## Deployment Identifiers

### DSEQ (Deployment Sequence)

A unique identifier for a deployment on the Akash blockchain.

```
dseq: 12345678
```

- Assigned when deployment is created on-chain
- Used to reference the deployment in all operations
- Immutable once assigned

### GSEQ (Group Sequence)

Identifies a group within a deployment. Most deployments have a single group (gseq: 1).

```
gseq: 1
```

- Groups allow deploying to multiple providers
- Each group can have different placement requirements
- Starts at 1 for each deployment

### OSEQ (Order Sequence)

Identifies an order within a group. Increments when a lease is closed and reopened.

```
oseq: 1
```

- Starts at 1 for new deployments
- Increments on lease migration or restart
- Used with dseq and gseq to identify a specific lease

### Lease ID

The combination of owner address, dseq, gseq, oseq, and provider address.

```
owner/dseq/gseq/oseq/provider
akash1abc.../12345678/1/1/akash1xyz...
```

## Core Concepts

### SDL (Stack Definition Language)

YAML configuration file defining a deployment:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:1.25.3
    expose:
      - port: 80
        to:
          - global: true
profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 0.5
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi
  placement:
    dcloud:
      pricing:
        web:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 1000
deployment:
  web:
    dcloud:
      profile: web
      count: 1
```

### Manifest

The SDL converted to a format sent to the provider. Contains deployment instructions without pricing information.

### Deployment

An on-chain record representing a tenant's intent to deploy workloads. Contains:
- Owner address
- SDL hash
- Escrow balance
- State (open, closed)

### Order

A request for bids on a deployment group. Providers monitor for orders matching their capabilities.

### Bid

A provider's offer to fulfill an order at a specific price.

### Lease

A binding agreement between tenant and provider:
- Created when bid is accepted
- Defines price per block
- Allows provider to deploy workload
- Continues until closed or funds depleted

## Actors

### Tenant (Deployer)

The user deploying workloads:
- Creates deployments
- Deposits escrow
- Accepts bids
- Manages leases

### Provider

Entity running compute infrastructure:
- Operates Kubernetes cluster
- Runs provider software
- Submits bids on orders
- Deploys and manages workloads

### Auditor

Trusted entity that verifies provider attributes:
- Signs provider attestations
- Enables attribute filtering
- Builds trust in provider claims

### Validator

Secures the Akash blockchain:
- Runs consensus node
- Validates transactions
- Earns staking rewards

## Payment Terms

### uakt

Micro-AKT, the smallest denomination:

```
1 AKT = 1,000,000 uakt
```

### Escrow

Funds deposited for a deployment:
- Required before deployment starts
- Drawn down per block
- Returned on close (minus spent)

### Bid Price

Amount provider charges per block:

```yaml
pricing:
  web:
    denom: uakt
    amount: 1000  # per block (~6 seconds)
```

Monthly cost calculation:
```
blocks_per_month = 438,000 (approx)
monthly_cost = amount × blocks_per_month
1000 uakt × 438,000 = 438,000,000 uakt = 438 AKT
```

## Provider Terms

### Attributes

Key-value pairs describing provider capabilities:

```yaml
attributes:
  region: us-west
  host: akash
  tier: community
```

### Signed By

Auditor signatures that verify provider attributes:

```yaml
signedBy:
  anyOf:
    - akash1auditor...
```

### Bid Engine

Provider component that:
- Monitors for matching orders
- Calculates bid prices
- Submits bids automatically

## Infrastructure Terms

### Kubernetes

Container orchestration platform used by providers:
- Runs workloads as pods
- Manages networking and storage
- Provides service discovery

### Ingress

Kubernetes component exposing services:
- Routes external traffic
- Handles TLS termination
- Provides hostnames for deployments

### Persistent Volume

Storage that survives container restarts:
- Mounted to containers
- Backed by provider storage class
- beta2, beta3, or ram classes

## State Machine

### Deployment States

```
Active: Deployment is running
Closed: Deployment is terminated
```

### Order States

```
Open: Accepting bids
Matched: Bid accepted, lease created
Closed: No longer accepting bids
```

### Lease States

```
Active: Workload running
Closed: Lease terminated
Insufficient Funds: Escrow depleted
```
